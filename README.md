# Dotfiles managed by Nix

## Getting Started

Run `nix develop` to start a development shell with `just`.
Then run `just --list`  to see what commands you can run.

## Caveats

This project assumes a particular undocumented MacOS
configuration.  Work is in progress to document this and
modularlize components to be more reusable.
